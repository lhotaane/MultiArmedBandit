# MultiArmedBandit
The implementation of basic strategies solving Multi Armed Bandit problem.

In this repository is presented a solution to Multi Armed Bandit problem using heuristic as eps-greedy, eps-decay, Optimistic Initial Value and SoftMax strategies. The repository includes:

* main.ipynb - run skript with explanation and vizualization
* bandits.py - module includit implemented strategies
* multi_armed_bandit.webm - video from https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2020/08/05/bandits/ for explaination purpose

This project is ispired by research done by
* Christian Hubbs via https://towardsdatascience.com/multi-armed-bandits-and-reinforcement-learning-dc9001dcb8da
* paper "Algorithm for the multi-armed bandit problem" by Volodymyr Kuleshov and Doina Precup
